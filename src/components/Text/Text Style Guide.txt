Welcome to Quiver's Text Style Guide!

-------

Each text component in this app has its own design values.
We have created a dedicated text component for every text style used, following our design system.

-------

Each text component accepts two style values: {light/dark, bold/regular}.
If no value is selected, the component uses its default style.

The following properties cannot be changed: size, letter spacing (leading), and line height.

-------

Titles:

Title1 – Used for large titles, such as in the hero section.
Title2 – Used for important sections or areas that require emphasis.
Title3 – Used for smaller section titles or specific titles.

-------

Subtitles:

SubTitle1 – Used below Title1.
SubTitle2 – Used below Title2 or Title3.

-------

Body Text:

TextBody – Used for regular body text, such as footers and buttons (approximately 16px on laptop screens).
